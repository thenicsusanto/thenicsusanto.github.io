                        <p>Hi everyone, its been a while. I have not posted in 7 months and A LOT has happened since then. These 7 months were probably had some of the best moments of my life, however, and I'd like to share just a little bit about it. I'm now at the University of Washington and graduated high school in May. </p>

After Japan I'll definitely write a blog about my time there, but in this blog I wanted to talk about my final travel conference at the National High School Model United Nations (NHSMUN) conference in New York. </p>

In this blog I'm just gonna go through my thoughts on the college apps process and my personal advice which you should probably take as a grain of salt. </p>

                        <p>To be completely honest, this album was pretty mediocre. The only song I really enjoyed was First Person Shooter but everything else was either decent or bad. 8AM in Charlotte, Gently, Daylight were decent songs as well. It feels like Drake does not have to drop good music now because he is so popular, and people will listen to his music anyways, no matter the quality. </p>

Although I have not played with procedural generation in Unity or in general, I've been reading a lot of blogs, posts, and YouTube videos on this topic. I'm actually going to present about procedural generation and randomness to </p>

The 3 weeks before last week, I was working on a new virtual reality game for the original game round of the National High School Game Academy at Carnegie Mellon. If you don't know, NHSGA is a pre college program at CMU where for the last 3 weeks,</p>

                        <p>I was not expecting an album like this from Travis. The main vibe I got from listening was a more darker/hellish one, which is fine by me. Going into the album, I was expecting a vibe similar to Astroworld or Rodeo, but I was surprised by how different it was.

I was assigned four random teammates, creating a team of 5. I had the role as a programmer, while my teammates consisted of two artists, a sound designer, and another programmer. We had to recreate and re-theme Q*bert.

                        <p>Hey everybody, sorry for the long wait. I'm currently attending pre college at CMU, so I've been very busy the past two weeks. However, the week before I came to Pittsburgh I was actually pretty successful in using Ableton. To be completely honest, it had the easiest user interface I've ever seen and used in any software I've downloaded.

                           my progress on whatever I'm working on and other random things I find interesting.
                           I've never seen myself as an exceptional writer/journalist, but I've realized blogging
                           your own work is one of the most underrated things, so I had to give it a try.
